    % Opening Exercise
    \section*{Before You Begin}
    The following diagram represents a simple \emph{abstraction} of a computer system.

    \begin{figure}[h]

    Based on your own knowledge of computers, complete the following table with a brief description of each component. Include examples of computer hardware which would fulfill each role, where appropriate.

    \Question{A diagram such as the one above is a form of \emph{abstraction}. This abstraction hides the complexity of the specific inner workings of a computer system behind a simple flow diagram. Why do you think understanding abstractions such as these is important to the study of computer science?}{3cm}

    \subsection*{Adding Complexity}
    The following diagram shows a more complete view of a computer system. Note the additional complexity outlined in the CPU and Primary Memory sections of the diagram.

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\boxwidth]{Extras/computer_abstraction_complex}

    \subsubsection*{Notes}

    \vfill

    \Question{Although the above diagram has an increased level of complexity, it still represents only an abstraction of a computer system. Why might we want to represent the same system at different levels of abstraction?}{3cm}

    \Question{Secondary memory devices, such as traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) are extremely common in computer systems. Briefly explain the need for these secondary memory devices. Are there any computer systems that might not require secondary memory?}{3cm}

    \subsection*{Even More Complexity}
    The following diagram represents the most complex abstraction of a computer system we will be discussing. It includes the L1/L2/etc. caches as part of the CPU.

        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\boxwidth]{Extras/computer_abstraction_complex2}
        \caption{Adding even more complexity by examining the CPU's cache memory.}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection*{Notes}

    \vfill
    
    \Question{Modern processors often include many different ``levels'' of caches, numbered according to their ``closeness'' to the main control unit. What impact do you think this has on the performance of the computer system? Why do you think different levels of caches are used rather than increasing the size of a single cache?}{4cm}
