    \subsection*{The Role of the Operating System}
    The following diagram is an abstraction showing where the operating system exists in relation to the user applications and the system hardware.

    \subsection*{Monolithic vs. Microkernel Operating Systems}

    The following two diagrams show a sample of fundamental services offered by the operating system, and where they would exist within a monolithic or microkernel operating system architecture.

    \subsubsection*{Notes}

    \vfill

    \Question{Monolithic kernels run a higher risk of instability due to all services being included in a single process. Despite this, operating systems which are considered \emph{more stable} and \emph{more secure}, such as Linux, generally use monolithic kernels, while systems considered \emph{less stable} and \emph{less secure}, such as Mac OSX and Windows, use microkernels. Why do you think this contradiction exists?}{4cm}

    \section*{Reflections}

    \Question{Significant advances and changes in computer hardware frequently require updates to an operating system's kernel, particularly in monolithic systems such as Linux. Do you think operating system vendors should push for more standardization of computer hardware? Why or why not?}{4cm}

    \Question{Windows Vista and newer require kernel-mode device drivers to be ``digitally signed'' by Microsoft. This process verifies a drivers use and authenticity. Why do you think Microsoft implemented this security measure?}{4cm}
